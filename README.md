Before starting, download the server by [clicking here](https://utrains.s3.amazonaws.com/classmaterials/REDHAT8EXAM.ova).
    
2.  Go through the following slide to import the server into your Virtualbox and break the root password to access the server.  **Note:** If you face any issues importing the server, follow the slide after this
