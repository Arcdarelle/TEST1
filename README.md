### 1\. What is Telegram ?

        Telegram is an online messaging app that works just like popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. This means that you can use it to send messages to your friends when connected to Wi-Fi or your mobile data. Telegram is cloud-based and claims that it prioritizes security and speed, making it a good alternative to other popular messaging apps. The service launched in 2013, and since then it has reached 200 million active monthly users.

### 2\. Why do we prefer telegram over WhatsApp ?

WhatsApp allows to add only 256 people to a group, whereas in Telegram groups, it is possible add up to 200,000 people. Since we have sometimes more than 256 members to integrate in the groups for each session, we have privileged Telegram over WhatsApp.
